  This function takes care of sending all global signals. (This means they are not socket-specific signals, such as "joining the room was succesful")
  The reason this is a function, is because there are 
   => several types of signals (pre signal, normal signal, player-specific signal, etc.)
   => AND we want to save those signals in history (to allow rejoin/room watch functionality)
  Right now, players have no signalHistory (just a preSignal and a is-the-player-done boolean; this could change when I start making more complex games)

  @parameter room => the main room in which to send the signal
  @parameter monitor => true if the signal is sent to monitors, false if it's sent to controllers
  @parameter label => the name/label for the signal
  @parameter info => the info that's sent with the signal
  @parameter preSignal => whether it's a presignal 
                          (presignals are stored elsewhere than all other signals, because they are sent at different times for different purposes)
  @parameter storeSignal => true if the signal should be saved, false if not
